To import PHOIBLE's data to the database, download phoible-phonemes.tsv and phoible-segments-features.tsv, move them to scripts/, and run scripts/tsv-import-inventories.rb and scripts/tsv-import-segments.rb in the Rails environment (`rails runner scripts/tsv-foo.rb`) once the database has been initialized from the schema.
