<h3>Segments with no featural decomposition</h3>
<p>
  Note that there are ten segments associated with languages in PHOIBLE's database for which PHOIBLE doesn't provide a feature set. Four of these have been manually corrected: in the feature-set listings, <em>ã̟ĩ</em>, <em>mːʷˠ</em>, <em>pːʷˠ</em>, and <em>ŋːʷ</em> have been changed to <em>ã̟ĩ</em>, <em>mʷˠː</em>, <em>pʷˠː</em>, and <em>ŋʷː</em>, to match the equivalent segments listed for languages. These segments appear in, respectively: KIOWA (UPSID); Satawalese (PH); Satawalese (PH); and Panamint (PH). The six others, which are currently unsearchable, are: <em>ˀnʘ</em>, <em>ˀnǁ</em>, <em>ˀnǀ</em>, <em>ˀnǃ</em>, and <em>ˀnǂ</em>, all of which appear only in !Xóõ (GM), and <em>N</em>, which appears in Ika (SAPHON), Asháninka (SAPHON), Caquinte (SAPHON), Nanti (SAPHON), Ashéninka (Ucayali-Yurúa dialect) (SAPHON), Ashéninka (Apurucayali dialect) (SAPHON), Ashéninka (Pichis dialect) (SAPHON), Matsigenka (SAPHON), Nomatsigenga (SAPHON), and Ashéninka (Perené dialect) (SAPHON).

<h3>Unattested segments with featural decompositions</h3>
<p>
  There are 20 segments (after the aforementioned manual correction) that PHOIBLE provides a feature set for, but that don't appear in any language in PHOIBLE's database. These are as follows: <em>tʃ</em>, <em> dʒ</em>, <em> tʃʰ</em>, <em> tʃʼ</em>, <em> n̠d</em>, <em> ẽ̞ĩ</em>, <em> kʼʷ</em>, <em> ɨ̞̃</em>, <em> qʼʷ</em>, <em> ĩẽ̞</em>, <em> kːʷ</em>, <em> ãõ̞ˤ</em>, <em> ẽ̞ũ</em>, <em> n̠t</em>, <em> cçʲ</em>, <em> æ̞̃</em>, <em> j̤</em>, <em> õ̞</em>, <em> ẽ̞</em>, <em> ṵ̃</em>. Segments that don't appear in any language in PHOIBLE's database are excluded from search results.
</p>

<h3>Non-IPA notation</h3>
<p>
  The string <i>*R</i> in PHOIBLE represents what UPSID calls an "r-sound" &mdash; that is, an unspecified coronal rhotic. It appears in the following segments: *R̪ *R *Rʲ *R̪̥ *R̪̰. There are some other unusual uses of notation, which originate in the source papers; e.g. Ikalanga (GM) uses <i>pk</i> instead of <i>kp</i> for the voiceless labial-velar stop. 
</p>

<h3>Non-unique featural decompositions</h3>
<p>
  PHOIBLE's featural decomposition is non-unique. A script to print all sets of phonemes with identical featural decompositions is included in the source code repository of this site, at scripts/underspecified.rb.
